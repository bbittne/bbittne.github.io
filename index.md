Hi everyone! I am currently a Masters in Statistics student at NC State. This blog is for the ST558 Data Science course as part of that program. As you can imagine, this blog will likely be stats and tech related, with a focus on Data Science.

I am currently employed at the North Dakota Office of State Tax Commissioner, more commonly known as the department of revenue. I have been with the agency for almost 15 years. I have been a software engineer for a vast majority of my time. I was recently promoted into a research analyst type role thanks in part to being in this program here at NC State.

When I'm not working or studying, I also have three young kids that keep me very busy. They are Emmett (7), Clara (5), and Scarlett (2).
